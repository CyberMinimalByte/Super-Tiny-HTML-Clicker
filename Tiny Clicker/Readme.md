# Minimal Clicker

This is a simple clicker implemented in a single HTML file. The goal was to create a functional click counter with the smallest possible file size.

## Features

- A button to increment the counter.
- A numeric display showing the current count.
- Minimal use of HTML and JavaScript to keep the file size extremely low (under 100 bytes).

## Usage

Open the `index.html` file in any modern web browser. Click the button to increase the counter.

## File Size

The HTML file is approximately 97 bytes in size, making it extremely lightweight and easy to host or distribute.

## Purpose

This project serves as an experiment in minimal web development and file size optimization.
